# Hey! We are IntelliVision! 👋



Welcome to IntelliVision’s GitHub page!

We are a team of students pursuing a BSc in Software Engineering at the University of Southern Denmark (SDU) in Sønderborg. 2024-2025 3rd and 4th Semesters. We’re diving deep into the exciting world of software and web development as part of our studies in **Web Technologies** and **Semester Projects**.

## About IntelliVision 👾

We bulldoze through courses with innovative projects that challenge us to grow and explore new skills. From interactive web apps to intelligent systems, we’re dedicated to creating impactful solutions that not only meet academic requirements but also hold real-world value.

Each of us brings a unique set of skills and experiences to the table, whether in coding, design, or problem-solving. Together, we’re committed to learning, experimenting, and building meaningful projects that reflect our shared passion for technology.

Our team name, *IntelliVision*, is inspired by the classic Intellivision gaming console from the 1980s. Originally developed by Mattel Electronics, the Intellivision console was one of the first home gaming systems to bring advanced graphics and innovative gameplay to living rooms around the world.

- **Develop meaningful, user-centered projects** that showcase our skills and creativity

- **Explore modern technologies** and implement best practices in software engineering
